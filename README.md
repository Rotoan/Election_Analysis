# Election_Analysis
DU Module 3, election analysis using python in VS Code

# Objectives
## 1. Total number of votes cast
## 2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
## 3. Total number of votes each candidate received
## 4. Percentage of votes each candidate won
## 5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

# Resources
-Data Source: election_results.csv
-Software: Python 3.7.6

# Results
Winner: Diana DeGette with a vote count of 272,892 which is 73.8% of total votes
The county with the largest share of voter turnout was Denver, which had 82.8% of votes cast

# Challenges
Data does not break down types of votes, this analysis completely relies on the accuracy of the raw vote count resource.
Further data does not contain voter registration information, and therefore does not calculate turnout based on potential voters. This means that only raw turnout numbers are available.
